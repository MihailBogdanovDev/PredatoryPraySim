# PredatoryPraySim

##Overall desctiption
A project I worked on for my AI for Society Minor. Uses Unity's ML Agents to create Wolves and Deer behaviour using Reinforcment learning. You can select how much trees, deer and wolves you would like to put in the simulation. After the simulation is done the population fulctuation gets compared to a real life equation called the Lotka Volterra eqation, of how the population would have moved in the real world. You can read the documentation to see the development process.
